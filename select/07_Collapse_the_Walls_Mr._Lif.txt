Verse 1
Where's the law that says if I make a buck, you've gotta get a cut? / Get the fuck outta my pockets and my eye sockets / Bad programming with a smooth slow jam in the background / That's how you've got us all strapped down / That sound that I hear / you telling us to fear / like the muthafuckin' earth will end this year / Yeah / It's that same old same old / Actual development is in slow mo / Work a steady day job then go home / You're free to roam anywhere within our zone / Hmmmm / Not really loving all the options? / Here's a little tax break / Now go shopping! / Am I the only one that feels hollow? / a sense of sorrow / from a pre-designed tomorrow? / This world only exists for monetary cause / We should use our mind power to collapse the walls /
Verse 2
When I use the term "The World" / I'm referring to the complex / Megaplex / that never let's you breathe / "Fly over it" / but it never let's you leave / "And you only know" / everything it let's you see / O.D. on the norm / til we all conform / same attitude / same shoes and ties are worn / then swarm to the screen / til the images seen / make you forget to dream / only living for the green and... / maybe we should take it to the start again / burn up all the money and then start bartering / smarter than, this construct / misconduct / awe struck / at the fact that we're all fucked! / All ducks in a row, thriving off one mineral / Hurts on the low / so I compose syllables / Visual / This empire's gonna fall / if we use our mind power ti collapse the walls
Verse 3
Take a deep breath / as I give it my best / to flee the realms of stress / Look! now I'm at the top of Everest / At the crest with my Emperess / I suggest, we reside at no particular address / Leave the world behind / See the true divine lack of limitation through creation / It can't be found within the borders of the nation / Patiently I ski on treetops and eavesdrop / as the leaves talk / if there's an earthquake / I let the beat drop / Knees knock in panic / so I cradle the planet / take a thought and expand it / til it becomes a mode of transit / and it takes me / where my imagination finds elation / to define senation / I had to cling to correlation / For a patient waiting in my foyer / I'm like Okoye / run through / hit em with that check one two / Travel from the stage to the stone age without a pause / cause I use my mind power to collapse the walls
